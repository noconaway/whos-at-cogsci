#Who's at Cogsci? 2016

##Notes:

1. Getting rid of multiple instantiations of individual authors, the name representation is firstletter_firstname full_lastname (i.e., "N Conaway").
2. 

##Todo:

1. Make downloadhtml.py slicker, generate list of file rather than constructing on the fly. Maybe zip or something would work?
2. Social network analysis -- what are the clusters of connected authors?
3. Who's got the most presentations?
4. Put the whole darn thing on a Gist
