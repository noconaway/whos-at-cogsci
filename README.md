#Who's at Cogsci? 2016

##Todo:

1. **Create a co-authorship network, what are the clusters of connected authors?** I put a little time into this, but the edges are really sparse and I'm not a network whiz.
2. **Additions to the author similarity plot.** Cluster the author similarity figure and illustrate each cluster's most common terms.
3. **Fixing the presentation frequency plot.** Make x axis more clearly alphabetical --  indicate start of last name letter with x tick
4. Deal with cached HTML on the .io page.
5.
