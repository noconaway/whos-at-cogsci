#Who's at Cogsci? 2016

##Notes:

1. Getting rid of multiple instantiations of individual authors, the name representation is firstletter_firstname full_lastname (i.e., "N Conaway").
2. `data.tsv` is a boolean author-by-presentation ownership matrix. This should be useful in computing most things.... 

##Todo:

1. Make downloadhtml.py slicker, generate list of file rather than constructing on the fly. Maybe zip or something would work?
2. Social network analysis -- what are the clusters of connected authors?
3. Presentation frequency plot: make x axis more clearly alphabetical --  indicate start of last name letter with x tick
4. Use sqlite instead of tsv for data storage
