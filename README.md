#Who's at Cogsci? 2016

##Todo:

1. **Create a co-authorship network, what are the clusters of connected authors?** I put a little time into this, but the edges are really sparse and I'm not a network whiz.
2. **Additions to the author similarity plot.** Cluster the author similarity figure and illustrate each cluster's most common terms. Is there a better distance metric than Jaccard? Are there any special procedure for dealing with sparse data?
3. **Fixing the presentation frequency plot.** Make x axis more clearly alphabetical --  indicate start of last name letter with x tick
4. Deal with cached HTML on the .io page.
5. Would *love* to be able to search names in the interactives.
6. R code for platform-independent paths, both loading and saving. One working example at top if  `author.similarity.r`
